#  Challange-1  Wallet Connection
This challenge-1 for. To begin, ensure you have the Phantom wallet extension installed in your browser. Open the Phantom wallet and create a new Solana account by following the on-screen instructions. Once your account is created, navigate to the settings or connection section within Phantom, and connect it to your newly created Solana account.

After establishing the connection, explore Solana's ecosystem to find airdrop opportunities. Participate in eligible projects or communities that distribute SOL tokens through airdrops. Once you've successfully received an airdrop, head back to your Phantom wallet. Locate the option for transferring tokens within the wallet interface.

Initiate a SOL token transfer by providing the recipient's address and the desired amount. Confirm the transaction details and authorize the transfer through Phantom. You can track the status of your transaction using the Solana blockchain explorer or within the Phantom wallet's transaction history.

To verify the completion of the transfer, check your wallet balance within the Phantom interface. Your updated SOL token balance should reflect the successful transfer. This demonstrates the seamless process of connecting, receiving airdrops, and transferring SOL tokens using the Solana blockchain and the Phantom wallet.

## Getting Started
To create a new Solana account, you can use the official Solana wallet or a supported wallet application. Once your account is set up, you can connect it to an existing Phantom wallet by following the integration instructions provided by Phantom. After connecting, you may request an airdrop of SOL tokens through various Solana community channels or projects that distribute tokens.
